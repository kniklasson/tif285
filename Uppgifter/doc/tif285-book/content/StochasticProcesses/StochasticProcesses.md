# Stochastic processes

```{epigraph}
> "Stochastic, or random, processes is the dynamic side of probability. What differential equations is to calculus, stochastic processes is to probability."

-- Robert P. Dobrow, *Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R*
```

A stochastic (random) process is simply one in which outcomes are uncertain. By contrast, a deterministic process always produces the same result for a given input. While functions and differential equations are often used to describe deterministic processes, we can use random variables and probability distribution functions to describe stochastic ones. 

Stochastic processes are very useful for the modeling of systems that have inherent randomness. This is certainly true in physics, and not the least for quantum systems. We will not delve deep into this topic in these notes. You might encounter stochastic modeling in the future when studying, for example, statistical physics. 

Instead, our specific goal is to become familiar with a special kind of stochastic processes known as Markov chains. Having defined and studied general properties, we will find that such chains be designed to produce samples from a stationary probability distribution of our choice.

```{prf:example} An exponential growth model
:label: example:exponential-growth-models

Consider a simple exponential growth model to describe a population of bacteria in a culture with a food source. In a deterministic model we assert that the population grows at a fixed rate $\lambda$. The growth rate is then proportional to the population size as described by the differential equation

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt} = \lambda y(t).
\end{equation}

With the initial population $y(0) = y_0$, this equation is solved by the exponential function 

\begin{equation}
y(t) = y_0 \exp(\lambda t),
\end{equation} 

from which the population is precisely determined. For example, with $y_0 = 10$ and $\lambda = 0.25$ per minute we find that the population has almost doubled four times
after 11 minutes (since $y(11) = 15.6 \approx 16$). 

This model, however, does not take into account the randomness of the reproduction of individual organisms. This can be considered in a stochastic growth model where we assign the probability $\lambda \Delta t$ for a single bacteria to split once during a (very short) time interval $\Delta t$. This random process can be simulated using a short python script (click below to show the code). Ten different realizations of the stochastic model are visualized in {numref}`fig-bacterial-growth` and compared with the deterministic one. Questions that might be of scientific interest include:

* What is the expected number of bacteria at time $t$?
* What is the probability that the number of bacteria will exceed some threshold value after $t$ minutes?
* What is the distribution of the time it takes for the population to double in size?

## Definition of a stochastic process

Using probability theory, a stochastic process $X$ is a family 

\begin{equation}
\{X_t \; : \; t \in T\},
\end{equation}

of random variables $X_t$ indexed by some set $T$. All the random variables take values in a common state space, $S$. The state space can be discrete or continuous. Although we might use discrete state spaces in some of the examples, one should realize that most examples in physics belong to the continuous type.

Furthermore, the family is known as **discrete process** if the indices take discrete values $T = \{0,1,2,\ldots\}$. This will in fact be the situation in the practical application of **Markov chain Monte Carlo** applications that we are aiming for. On the other hand, many physical stochastic processes are **continuous** and will have $T \in \mathbb{R}$ or $T \in [0,\infty)$. In either case we think of a stochastic process as a family of variables that evolve as time passes, although in general $T$ might be any kind of ordering index and is not restricted to physical time.

Due to the randomness, different runs of the stochastic process will generate different sequences of outputs. An observer recording many such sequences generated from the same stochastic process would need to measure all the following conditional probabilities to fully describe the process:

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
p_{X_0}(x_0), \\
p_{X_1 \vert X_0}(x_1 | x_0), \\
p_{X_2 \vert X_0, X_1}(x_2 | x_0, x_1), \\
\vdots\\
p_{X_n \vert X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{n-1}} \left( x_n | x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1} \right).
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

```{prf:example} Conditional probabilities of a stochastic process
:label: example:conditional-stochastic-process

Below is an example of a stochastic process (implemented using an abstract python class [`StochasticProcess`](https://gitlab.com/cforssen/tif385-book/-/blob/tif385/content/Utils/StochasticProcess/StochasticProcess.py)).

Note that the process indeed is defined by: 
1. the distribution of the first random variable $X_0$, which is included in the definition of class method `start`, and 
2. the conditional distributions for subsequent variables (as defined in the class method `update`). 

Two relevant visualizations are also included in the example below
* Plots of the first variables from a few runs.
* A corner plot of bivariate and univariate marginal distributions.
```

```{code-cell} python3

from StochasticProcess.StochasticProcess import StochasticProcess as SP

        return random_state.uniform()

    def update(self, random_state, history):
        return np.sum(history) + random_state.uniform()

```

```{exercise}
:label: exercise:conditional-probabilities-stochastic-process

For each panel of the pairplot above:

* What conditional distribution of random variables does each panel show?
* What random variables are marginalized out, if any?
* Explain how the pairplot answers the question "Are $X_3$ and $X_0$ independent?"?

Hints: 
* The top-left panel shows $\p{X_0}$, with no marginalization since $X_0$ starts the random sequence. 
* The independence of $X_3$ and $X_0$ would imply $\pdf{X_3}{X_0}=\p{X_3}$.

## Example: Random walk

One of the simplest random processes is the so called *random walk*. This process can arise in many ways. A standard example is the coin-flip casino game in which a gambler G starts with a fortune $a$. The croupier tosses a (possibly biased) coin. Each time heads appears, the gambler gets one euro (let us assume that the game takes place in Monte Carlo). If tails appears, the player loses one euro. 

The player's fortune $S_n$  after $n$ tosses is

\begin{equation}
S_n = a + \sum_{i=1}^n X_i,
\end{equation}

where $X_i$ is a random variable with possible outcomes $\{-1,1\}$. The probability mass function is $\{ p(X_i = -1) = p, p(X_i = 1) = 1-p \}$, where an unbiased coin would have $p=0.5$. The fortune $S_n$ can be considered a random walk stochastic process. A number of different scenarios can be considered by imposing external constraints on the gambler's fortune (such as the termination of the game when $S_n = 0$).

```{prf:example} Simple random walk
:label: example:simple-random-walk
In the following code example (again using the `StochasticProcess` class) we create a large number of such processes starting at $X_0 = 0$. Here we investigate the questions:

* What is the mean position of the random walk after $n$ steps?
* What is the average distance traveled after $n$ steps?

Can you formulate these questions as some moments of a probability distribution?
```

```{code-cell} python3
class randomwalk(SP):
    def start(self,random_state):
        return 0.

    def update(self, random_state, history):
        step = np.sign(random_state.uniform()-0.5)
        return history[-1]+step

test=randomwalk(seed=1)
test.create_multiple_processes(20,5)
test.plot_processes()

test.create_multiple_processes(101,5000)

for step in [9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]:
    mean = test.sequence[step,:].mean()
    std = test.sequence[step,:].std()
    print(f'After {step:>3} steps: mean = {mean:5.3f}, std = {std:6.2f}')
```


These walks can be made more general by allowing the steps $X_n$ to have some continuous distribution on the reals, and it can be placed in a multi-dimensional space with both positions and steps in $\mathbb{R}^p$. A particularly well-known random walk process involves the motion of a particle in a fluid where it is subjected to multiple collisions. This gives a so called *Brownian motion*.


## Special case: Gaussian process

{{ sub_extra_admonition }}

The joint density function for a multivariate normal distribution was presented in Eq. {eq}`eq:Statistics:multivariate-normal-PDF` for $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)$ corresponding to random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots X_k$. This normal distribution is completely determined by its mean vector, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, and covariance matrix, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, where elements $\mu_i = \expect{X_i}$ and $\Sigma_{ij} = \cov{X_i}{X_j}$.

The multivariate normal distribution has the remarkable property that all marginal and conditional distributions are normal, and specified by the corresponding subsets of the mean vector and covariance matrix. 

A Gaussian process extends the multivariate normal distribution to a stochastic process with a continuous time index $T$.

```{prf:definition} Gaussian process
:label: definition:gaussian-process

A Gaussian process $(X(t))_{t \geq 0}$ is a stochastic process with a continuous-time index $t \in [0,\infty)$ if each finite-dimensional vector of random variables 

$$
X(t_1), X(t_2), \ldots, X(t_k)
$$ 

has a multivariate distribution for $0 \leq t_1 < \ldots < t_k$.

A Gaussian process is completely determined by its *mean function* $\mu(X(t))$ and *covariance function* $C(X(s), X(t))$ for $s, t \geq 0$.

```  

A Gaussian process is stationary if the mean function $\mu(X(t))$ is constant for all $t$ and if the covariance function fulfils $C(X(s), X(t)) = C(X(s+h), X(t+h))$ with $h \geq 0$. Note that stationarity is not a requirement for a Gaussian process.

```

````{solution} exercise:conditional-probabilities-stochastic-process
:label: solution:conditional-probabilities-stochastic-process
:class: dropdown

The histograms on the diagonal show the distributions $\p{X_n}$ which are marginalized over $X_{n−1}, \ldots, X_0$. The off-diagonal plots show the joint distributions $\p{X_i,X_j}$ which are marginalized over $X_{n−1}, \ldots, X_0$ with $n=\max(i,j)$ and excluding $X_{\min(i,j)}$. Note that these are distributions of random variables $X_n$, not random values $x_n$.

More explicitly:

* $\p{X_0}$ has no correlated random variables marginalized out since it starts the sequence.
* $\p{X_1}$ is marginalized over $X_0$.
* $\p{X_2}$ is marginalized over $X_1,X_0$.
* $\p{X_3}$ is marginalized over $X_2,X_1,X_0$.
* $\p{X_0,X_1}$ has no correlated random variables marginalized out.
* $\p{X_1,X_2}$ is marginalized over $X_0$.
* $\p{X_2,X_3}$ is marginalized over $X_0, X_1$.
* $\p{X_1,X_3}$ is marginalized over $X_0, X_2$.
* $\p{X_0,X_3}$ is marginalized over $X_1, X_2$.
* $\p{X_0,X_2}$ is marginalized over $X_1, X_3$.

The dependence of $X_3$ on $X_0$ is not directly observed since $\pdf{X_3}{X_0}$ is not shown. However, from Eq. {eq}`eq:Statistics:conditional-probability` we have that $\pdf{X_3}{X_0} = \p{X_0,X_3} / \p{X_0}$. And since $\p{X_0}$ is uniform, we find that $\pdf{X_3}{X_0} \neq \p{X_3}$.
In other words, $X_3$ "remembers" $X_0$.

%--This exercise will explore the important Poisson distribution in
%--more detail and illustrate how the Poisson distribution can arise from a 
%--stochastic proccess.
%--
%--Define a stochastic process $\{X_i : i \in \{1,2,\dots\}\}$ where $X_i \sim 
%--\mathrm{exp}(\lambda)$ and independent. This means that the pdf is 
%--
%--$$f_{X_i}(x) = \begin{cases} \lambda e^{-\lambda x},

%--$$
%--
%--This stochatic process is quite trivial, sice it is just an i.i.d sequence of random variables being exponentially 
%--distributed.
%--
%--From this process define a new process $\{T_n : n \in \{1,2,\dots\}\}$ where
%--$T_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$.
%--
%--(i) Show that $\{T_n : n\in\{1,2,\dots\}\}$ is a Markov Process.
%--
%--(ii) Calculate the distribution function (cdf) of $T_n$, i.e. 
%--$F_{T_n} (t) = P(T_n \leq t)$ to show that $T_n \sim \Gamma(\lambda,n)$ 
%--
%--*Hint*: This is most easily shown by indction. (1.) Show that a exponential 
%--distribution is a special case of the $\Gamma$ distribution (2.) Consider 
%--the distribution of $Z = T_{n-1} + X_n$ where you assume that $T_{n-1}$ has a

%--This exercise will illustrate another situation where the Poisson distribution 
%--shows up.
%--
%--Consiser a physics experiment where you want to measure some process that emitts 
%--some kind of particle in different directions. The goal is to infer the probability
%--distribution that the particles follow. Consider that the detector is a screen
%--with some length, $L$, which is divided up in $K$ bins. The number of particels 
%--detected in each bin will approach the underlying probability distribution after 
%--long enough time, but for a finite number of samples it may look somethig like the
%--figure below. The red curv is the underlying pdf that we want to know, and the blue
%--histogram shown the outcome of the experiment.
%--
%--![file](./prob_fig.png)
%--
%--We will study the distribution of the number of particles in each bin, and how
%--that is affected by the number of particales that are detected, $N$, and the setup 
%--of the experiment. This distribution is important to be able to cunstruct the 
%--likelihood of the observed data given some model to describe the process.
%--
%--Suppuse that $N_i, \ i=1,\dots,K$ is the number of particles detected in the 
%--experiment in the corresponding bins. Let's focus on bin $i=1$.
%--
%--(*i*) Show that if all the particles can be considered independent the probability
%--of observing $N_i$ particles in bin $i=1$ is following a Binomial distribution. 
%--Assume that the variation of the underlying pdf can be considered constant 
%--in each bin, meaning that the widths of the bins are very small.
%--
%--*Hint*: Use that the random variable $N_i$ is a sum of Bernoulli distributed 
%--random variables.
%--
%--(*ii*) Compute the *generating function* for the Binomial distribution and 
%--the Poisson distribution.
%--
%--*Hint*: Remember that the generating function for a discrete random varaiable, $X$,
%--is defined as
%--
%--$$
%--G(s) =  \mathbb{E}\left(s^{X}\right) = \sum_n s^n \cdot f_X(n).
%--$$
%--
%--For the calculation of the generating function for the binomial distribution
%--you can use the fact that the binomial distribution is a sum of independent 
%--random variables with a generating function that is easier to compute.
%--
%--(*iii*) Prove the so-called Poisson Limit Theorem, that the binomial
%--distribution approaches the Poisson distribution in the limit 
%--
%--$$
%--N \to \infty, \quad N p_i \to \lambda. 
%--$$
%--
%--where $\lambda$ is a finite constant, i.e. 
%--
%--$$
%--P(N_i = n_i) \to_{N\to\infty} \frac{\lambda^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\lambda}
%--$$
%--
%--*Hint*: Use the definition of $e$ and explicitly construct a sequence of decreasing 
%--probabilities $p_i \to_{N\to\infty} 0$ that fulfills the constraint above.
%--
%--(*iv*) Use scipy-stats to compare the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution
%--and verify that the statement you just prove makes sense. Vary the size of 
%--$\lambda = p_i N \in \{0.5,2,10\}$ for large $N \sim 1000$. What do you observe?

%--o\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)$ (The small $o$ notation means that $N^m o(1/N^m)
%--\to_{N\to\infty} 0$) 
%--
%--- Looking at the generating function for the Binomial distribution we have
%--
%--$$
%--(ps + (1-p))^N = (1+p_N(s-1))^N = \exp{\left[N \ln\left( 1 +\frac{\lambda}{N} + 
%--o\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\right)\left(s-1\right)\right]}
%--$$
%--
%--Taylor expanding the logarithm and takning the limit gives
%--
%--$$
%--\exp\left[N\left(p_N(s-1) + o\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\right)\right] 
%--\to_{N\to\infty} \exp\left[\lambda(s-1)\right]
%--$$
