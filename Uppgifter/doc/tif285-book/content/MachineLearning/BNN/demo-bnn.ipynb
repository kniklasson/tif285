    "In this demonstration, it is shown how to use **Variational Inference** in PyMC3 to fit a simple Bayesian Neural Network. The authors will also discuss how bridging Probabilistic Programming and Deep Learning can open up very interesting avenues to explore in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilistic Programming at scale\n",
    "**Probabilistic Programming** allows very flexible creation of custom probabilistic models and is mainly concerned with **insight** and learning from your data. The approach is inherently **Bayesian** so we can specify **priors** to inform and constrain our models and get uncertainty estimation in form of a **posterior** distribution. Using [MCMC sampling algorithms](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/mcmc-sampling/) we can draw samples from this posterior to very flexibly estimate these models. PyMC3 and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) are the current state-of-the-art tools to consruct and estimate these models. One major drawback of sampling, however, is that it's often very slow, especially for high-dimensional models. That's why more recently, **variational inference** algorithms have been developed that are almost as flexible as MCMC but much faster. Instead of drawing samples from the posterior, these algorithms instead fit a distribution (e.g. normal) to the posterior turning a sampling problem into and optimization problem. [ADVI](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03431) -- Automatic Differentation Variational Inference -- is implemented in PyMC3 and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), as well as a new package called [Edward](https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/) which is mainly concerned with Variational Inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when it comes to traditional ML problems like classification or (non-linear) regression, Probabilistic Programming often plays second fiddle (in terms of accuracy and scalability) to more algorithmic approaches like [ensemble learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) (e.g. [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) or [gradient boosted regression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning))."

    "### Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in its third renaissance, deep learning has been making headlines repeatadly by dominating almost any object recognition benchmark, [kicking ass at Atari games](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf), and [beating the world-champion Lee Sedol at Go](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html). From a statistical point, Neural Networks are extremely good non-linear function approximators and representation learners. While mostly known for classification, they have been extended to unsupervised learning with [AutoEncoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) and in all sorts of other interesting ways (e.g. [Recurrent Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), or [MDNs](http://cbonnett.github.io/MDN_EDWARD_KERAS_TF.html) to estimate multimodal distributions). Why do they work so well? No one really knows as the statistical properties are still not fully understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of the innoviation in deep learning is the ability to train these extremely complex models. This rests on several pillars:\n",
    "* Speed: facilitating the GPU allowed for much faster processing.\n",
    "* Software: frameworks like [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) allow flexible creation of abstract models that can then be optimized and compiled to CPU or GPU.\n",
    "* Learning algorithms: training on sub-sets of the data -- stochastic gradient descent -- allows us to train these models on massive amounts of data. Techniques like drop-out avoid overfitting.\n",
    "* Architectural: A lot of innovation comes from changing the input layers, like for convolutional neural nets, or the output layers, like for [MDNs](http://cbonnett.github.io/MDN_EDWARD_KERAS_TF.html)."

    "### Bridging Deep Learning and Probabilistic Programming\n",
    "On one hand we have Probabilistic Programming which allows us to build rather small and focused models in a very principled and well-understood way to gain insight into our data; on the other hand we have deep learning which uses many heuristics to train huge and highly complex models that are amazing at prediction. Recent innovations in variational inference allow probabilistic programming to scale model complexity as well as data size. We are thus at the cusp of being able to combine these two approaches to hopefully unlock new innovations in Machine Learning. For more motivation, see also [Dustin Tran's](https://twitter.com/dustinvtran) recent [blog post](http://dustintran.com/blog/a-quick-update-edward-and-some-motivations/)."

    "While this would allow Probabilistic Programming to be applied to a much wider set of interesting problems, I believe this bridging also holds great promise for innovations in Deep Learning. Some ideas are:\n",
    "* **Uncertainty in predictions**: As we will see below, the Bayesian Neural Network informs us about the uncertainty in its predictions. I think uncertainty is an underappreciated concept in Machine Learning as it's clearly important for real-world applications. But it could also be useful in training. For example, we could train the model specifically on samples it is most uncertain about.\n",
    "* **Uncertainty in representations**: We also get uncertainty estimates of our weights which could inform us about the stability of the learned representations of the network.\n",
    "* **Regularization with priors**: Weights are often L2-regularized to avoid overfitting, this very naturally becomes a Gaussian prior for the weight coefficients. We could, however, imagine all kinds of other priors, like spike-and-slab to enforce sparsity (this would be more like using the L1-norm).\n",
    "* **Transfer learning with informed priors**: If we wanted to train a network on a new object recognition data set, we could bootstrap the learning by placing informed priors centered around weights retrieved from other pre-trained networks, like [GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842). \n",
    "* **Hierarchical Neural Networks**: A very powerful approach in Probabilistic Programming is hierarchical modeling that allows pooling of things that were learned on sub-groups to the overall population (see my tutorial on [Hierarchical Linear Regression in PyMC3](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/)). Applied to Neural Networks, in hierarchical data sets, we could train individual neural nets to specialize on sub-groups while still being informed about representations of the overall population. For example, imagine a network trained to classify car models from pictures of cars. We could train a hierarchical neural network where a sub-neural network is trained to tell apart models from only a single manufacturer. The intuition being that all cars from a certain manufactures share certain similarities so it would make sense to train individual networks that specialize on brands. However, due to the individual networks being connected at a higher layer, they would still share information with the other specialized sub-networks about features that are useful to all brands. Interestingly, different layers of the network could be informed by various levels of the hierarchy -- e.g. early layers that extract visual lines could be identical in all sub-networks while the higher-order representations would be different. The hierarchical model would learn all that from the data.\n",
    "* **Other hybrid architectures**: We can more freely build all kinds of neural networks. For example, Bayesian non-parametrics could be used to flexibly adjust the size and shape of the hidden layers to optimally scale the network architecture to the problem at hand during training. Currently, this requires costly hyper-parameter optimization and a lot of tribal knowledge."
