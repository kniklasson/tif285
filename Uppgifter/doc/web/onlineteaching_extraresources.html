    <h4>Yata Discussions</h4>
    <p>Yata Discussions facilitates group discussions between students and with teachers. Feel free to post questions, and to contribute with answers and hints. The discussion functionality is inspired by the <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> forums which are widely used, e.g., in coding communities. You can up- or down-vote posts and you can mark accepted answers. Our aim is to encourage collective efforts for increasing individual learning. The interface allows various advanced formatting: (i) latex for math expressions, (ii) code blocks, (iii) links, and you can upload images. Posts can be made anonymously (except for teachers whose names are always displayed).</p>
    <h4>Yata Questions</h4>
    <p>Yata Questions is used to automatically grade some of the code tasks in the problem sets.</p>
